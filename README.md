# Pytorch-DIMAN-for-Nuclei-Instance-Segmentation
This is a Pytorch implementation of Deep Interval-Masker-Aware Networks (DIMAN) and Marker-controlled Watershed. The original implementation of DIMAN is showed by [appiek](https://github.com/appiek/Nuclei_Segmentation_Experiments_Demo). If you use this code, please cite their paper showed in original implementation.

In this work, we keep the preprocessing matlab code and marker-controlled watershed code in original implementation. We changed the other parts to python and pytorch version.

The validation dataset is [TNBC](https://zenodo.org/record/1175282#.Xnk84G5uKhd) nuclei segmentation dataset. You can also use the dataset after our preprocessing, which can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16ajg19swFmvFqkH5sxsdoI3GX4aqjRB6/view?usp=sharing).
